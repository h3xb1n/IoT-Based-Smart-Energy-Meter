# IoT Based Smart Energy Meter
It is a Django Web Application, in which the user can view his live power usage of electricity day-wise, month-wise etc. with the bills. We have also provided the option to download the statistics of power usage in the excel format. How this works is that the Arduino Uno is connected to the energy meter. Arduino Uno calculates the live power usage with the help of current sensors and sends it to the web application with the help of ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. The application checks the database for latest record in time and plot it on the chart in the web application.
