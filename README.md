# IoT Based Smart Energy Meter
In the present billing system, the distribution companies are unable to track the changing demand of consumers and the consumers are facing the problems like receiving due bills for bills that have already been paid as well as poor reliability of electricity supply and quality even if bills are paid regularly. The present project mainly deals with smart energy meter, which utilizes the features of embedded systems in order to keep track of the consumers load timely, which will held to assure accurate billing, track maximum demand and to detect threshold value through the website which contributes to an efficient energy billing system using the Arduino Uno and Wi-Fi modems as well as addresses the problems faced by both the consumers and the distribution companies.
